A woman in Nigeria is 993 times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman in Norway. To understand a problem like that, our project explores how geography, gender inequality, and access to education and healthcare determine whether a woman survives childbirth, and why these deaths are preventable.

As a group of four, we explored several datasets, formed data visualizations that illustrated the statistics, and organized everything to make sure it clearly conveys the main idea of our project.
